      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I was working on a project in which I was creating loads of tap
devices, with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/galoisinc/hans&#34;&gt;HaNS&lt;/a&gt; instances connected to
them.  Initially, I was abusing the Galois network, stealing away precious
addresses from our internal /24 allocation.  This wasn&amp;rsquo;t the end of the world,
as I was reusing addresses I was given, but it got me thinking: shouldn&amp;rsquo;t I
be able to just allocate my own addresses?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
