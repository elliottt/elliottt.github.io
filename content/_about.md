My name is Trevor Elliott, I'm a programmer. You can find the software that I
write on [{{< feather "github" >}}github](https://github.com/elliottt). You
might also be interested in looking through my publications at [google
scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=s2Br_TMAAAAJ&hl=en).

The theme for this website is based on the color palette ["late night
bath"](https://lospec.com/palette-list/late-night-bath) by sukinapan.
